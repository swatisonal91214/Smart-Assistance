The summer season in India generally begins in March and lasts until June, bringing hot and dry weather conditions across most parts of the country. It is one of the most intense seasons due to India’s tropical and subtropical location. During this time, temperatures rise significantly, often crossing 40°C in northern and central regions, while southern coastal areas experience high humidity. Hot winds, locally known as loo, blow across the plains, making afternoons particularly harsh.

Despite the heat, summer is also a vibrant season in India. It is the time when nature offers a variety of fruits such as mangoes, watermelons, litchis, and muskmelons, which help people stay refreshed. People adapt to the weather by wearing light cotton clothes, drinking plenty of fluids, and preferring indoor activities during peak afternoon hours. In hilly regions like Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Kashmir, summer brings pleasant weather, attracting tourists seeking relief from the scorching heat.

Summer also plays an important role in agriculture, as it prepares the land for the arrival of the monsoon. While the heat can be challenging, the season carries cultural significance with festivals like Baisakhi and Rath Yatra. Overall, the Indian summer is a season of both hardship and vibrancy.
